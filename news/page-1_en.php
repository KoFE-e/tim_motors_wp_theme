                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Recently, we have become accustomed to huge dealer margins and unreasonably expensive additional equipment, without which many sellers refuse to give cars to customers. However, this is not only a Russian problem.

                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    A phenomenon called stealership (from the English dealership and steal) has existed there for a long time, but before, dishonest “wire dealers” earned mainly on after-sales service, imposing unnecessary work and rolling out inflated bills. Now, the disease has hit the sellers of new cars.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    NPR journalist Greg Rozalski investigated this phenomenon, resulting in a large publication, the translation of which we provide with minor edits. What for? Just to show that greed is an international phenomenon, and the ways of extracting profit in America are surprisingly consonant with Russian ones. So, over to Mr. Rosalsky.

                    The heyday of "divorced dealers" and the shadow economy of the automotive market. Inside view
                </div>

                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Some time ago, my pickup was stolen, so I had to look for a replacement. And for the first time in my life, I decided to buy a new car. This took many hours of searching. Painful trades. And meetings with many dealers, which can only be called false. The whole process turned out to be a nightmare.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Of course, cars are expensive, especially in times of scarcity due to disruption to supply chains. But it's not only that. Buying a car is not like buying most other goods. Unlike computers or, for example, refrigerators, cars are not sold at any one standard price. Ten people can walk into a dealership and each ends up paying different amounts for the same car.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Economists call this "price discrimination." This is when, instead of a single price for all, sellers charge a different price depending on how much the customer is willing to pay. Simply put, they are trying to milk you for as much money as possible. Not all dealers do this, but many are very aggressive, often using deceptive marketing gimmicks, hidden surcharges, and overpriced options like floor mats, alarms, and anti-corrosion treatments. Among clients, such offices are known as “divorced dealers”.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    The cunning pricing strategy that dealers use can drive buyers crazy, and I myself am terribly tired of haggling the price of a new pickup truck with slippery managers looking for the maximum benefit. Fortunately, my friend turned out to have a great talent for bargaining.

                    “The Goal Was Specifically to Get Rich”: Confessions of a Car Dealership Manager

                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    In economic research, patterns can be found that show who suffers the most from such policies. And there is little to enjoy. For example, several studies show that dealers charge more customers of color than whites. Another claims that older people have to pay more than younger people, and older women end up giving the most.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    The desire of a client to trade in an old car for a manager is something like a neon sign on his forehead with the inscription "Shake me more!". After all, selling an old car to a dealer is easier than through classifieds sites, but you get less money. This means that the client does not seek to save or waste money at all - therefore, the cost of a new car can be overestimated. And, of course, dealers look at what kind of car you trade-in: this is also a good indicator of solvency.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    In the normal world, when there are no supply problems and dealers are more concerned about emptying their own warehouses, cars often sell below the manufacturer's recommended prices. But now, when cars are in short supply, many sellers, on the contrary, greatly inflate the cost relative to the recommended one. Those who do not face rapid depletion of stocks, after which they are forced to wait for individual models for months, or even years.

                    “No loans and trade-in”: a salon employee revealed dealer schemes

                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at Cox Automotive (the company that owns Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader), comments: “For the first time in my career — and it's been a long career — I'm seeing dealers selling cars at recommended prices or more. The reasons for this are high demand, low inventory levels and the fact that they just can do it.” According to Krebs, in some cases, cheating amounts to tens of thousands of dollars.

                    Manufacturers versus dealers
                </div>

                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Dealers are usually independent and do not report directly to manufacturers, which means that, in fact, they can do whatever they want with prices. But many car companies aren't happy about the insane price hikes. A recent study by Growth of Knowledge shows that mark-ups do not worsen the attitude of customers towards a particular dealer, but towards the brand as a whole.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    And manufacturers know this. For example, this year Hyundai sent a letter to its dealer network urging them to stop deceptive practices such as online advertising with a low enticing price that gets much higher when customers come to the dealership. The Korean company complained that sky-high mark-ups "are harming our brand's long-term ability to attract new customers and retain old ones."
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Similarly, Ford demanded lower markups and threatened to cut deliveries of its most popular models if this did not happen. Yet the new F-150 Lightning electric pickup and Bronco SUV remain among the most hyped vehicles on the market, with dealers asking for far more than Ford claims. And all because car dealerships are independent, and in the phrase “recommended retail price”, the emphasis is on recommendations.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Young manufacturers like Tesla and Rivian are trying to build new sales and service networks that don't rely on independent dealers. Their model is based on direct deliveries to customers: you order a car on the Internet and receive it directly from the manufacturer. Without intermediaries in the form of greedy salesmen and tedious struggle for the price. And for "live" interaction, such companies have their own dealer and service centers.

                    However, many states have franchise laws that protect independent dealers - these laws make it very difficult to break the existing system and offer customers a potentially better way to buy a car.

                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    In fairness, it must be said that dealers are far from useless. They provide a distribution and service network that is important to both manufacturers and customers. Buyers get to explore the car, drive it, find out all the details - and all this costs dealers a pretty penny, because they need buildings, equipment and personnel. If a manufacturer announces a recall campaign, thousands of dealers across the country help resolve the issue. And of course, they create a lot of jobs.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    But there is a flip side to this: Widespread dealer networks gain more political power. Their scale is so great that officials at all levels, from local to federal, have to reckon with it. This, and the fact that this is a trillion dollar industry, makes dealers a powerful lobbying force. Opponents say the franchise protection laws created by these networks are preventing businesses from creating new business models that are more efficient and better suited to customers.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    We contacted the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), which represents more than 16,000 car dealerships across America, and received a response. “State legislatures have enacted and continue to actively support franchise protection laws to separate car production from sales, avoid price monopolization by manufacturers, promote sales and service competition, and preserve local jobs and investment,” commented the NADA vice president. Communications Jared Allen. “The franchise system contributes to all of these critical factors better than anything else.”

                    Five stories about how car buyers were "littered" at a car dealership

                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Some of these claims—for example, that dealers create jobs—are undeniable. But others raise a lot of questions. First, there are more than a dozen automakers in the US, and none even come close to being a monopoly. It's also not clear how adding middlemen can lower prices for customers, especially since the middlemen themselves rely on a arsenal of tricks to drive up those prices. By the way, many dealers are not a family business at all: the entire industry is continuously consolidating, and hundreds of salons across the country are now owned by multi-billion dollar corporations.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    For years, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whose responsibility it is to care for consumers, has been fighting to change franchise laws so that companies like Tesla and Rivian have more freedom to create new business models that work directly with customers. “States should allow customers to choose not only cars, but also how they buy them,” FTC officials wrote in 2015. But laws continue to protect the dealer model and discourage innovation.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    This summer, the FTC proposed new rules aimed at combating fraud and deception found at many dealerships. "In light of rising car prices, the commission aims to eliminate tricks and traps that make it difficult to compare price lists and load customers with thousands of dollars of unplanned "junk" overpayments," the statement said.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    In new rules, the FTC proposes a ban on deceptive advertising where dealers promise cars for much less than they intend to sell; ban "garbage surcharges for additional products and services that do not benefit customers"; and also require dealers to immediately publish all prices and terms of purchase of their cars.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    NADA, of course, opposes these rules. “The FTC proposals will cause huge harm to buyers because transactions will be greatly stretched in time, the buying process will become much more complicated and confusing, as a result, prices will rise, so NADA asks the FTC to return to the negotiating table and think carefully before pushing for the introduction of unexplored and untried rules. that will hit customers so hard,” said NADA Vice President of Communications Jared Allen.

                    How to buy a car in this crazy market
                </div>

                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    We asked Michelle Krebs, an automotive analyst with many years of experience, if she could offer advice on what to do in a crazy market. “I always advise patience and perseverance,” Krebs comments. — You need to methodically go through the offers, lay the flexibility when choosing and be prepared for the fact that you will not find the car of the exact make and model you want. And most importantly, expand your geography. Most don't want to travel more than 25 miles from home."

                    Looking for my new pickup truck, I spent many hours browsing the internet and talking to dozens of dealers all over the West Coast and inland. Some pickups cost $10,000 to $15,000 over the recommended prices, and I found a lot of shady tricks that the FTC is trying to crack down on. But there were also honest dealers who were ready to give a pickup truck at the RRP without bargaining. But here's the problem: he would have to wait at least six months. And since my old car was stolen from me, this option did not fit.
                </p>
                <p class="news-state__paragraph">
                    Luckily, my friend found exactly the car I wanted - 400 miles away in Southern California, not far from her parents' house. The dealer initially wanted $5,000 in excess of the recommended price, but through fierce negotiations, the deal came up to $2,000. In normal times, this would be considered robbery. But now is not a normal time.
